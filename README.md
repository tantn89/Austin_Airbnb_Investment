# Austin_Airbnb_Investment
In this project, I used Python and data visualization tools (Seaborn, Matplotlib) to analyze and illustrate the factors influencing Airbnb property profitability in Austin, Texas. The deep dive into datasets led to the identification of key performance indicators and the formulation of data-backed recommendations for investors. The project effectively translates intricate data insights into comprehensible visualizations, aiding investors in making informed decisions in the Austin Airbnb market.
